## Introduction

Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.
However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both the skills.

## Task
The task is to build SQL query to answer 10 ad hoc requests for which the business needs insights and create a presentation to show the insights to the top-level management.<br>
<br>

**Note**: **Ad hoc** is a Latin phrase that literally translates to '**for this**' or '**for this situation**'. Ad hoc requests are requests come unexpectedly without any prior planning. These requests often require immediate action.
